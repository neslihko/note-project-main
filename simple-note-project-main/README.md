## Project Purpose

In this project, you will design and build a content-sharing web application using **React** for the front-end and **Django REST Framework** for the back-end. This application allows users to browse and comment on each other's content, as well as add, edit, and delete their own posts. Users can follow one another, and the data is presented in a way that makes it easy for users to find what they are looking for.

Note: Unlike previous projects, this project requires you to provide two repositoriesâ€”one for the front-end and one for the back-end.

## Main Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React.js
- Bootstrap.js
- Django REST Framework
